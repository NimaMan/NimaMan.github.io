I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Industrial Engineering and Innovations Sciences Department at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I have obtained my Masters and Ph.D. in Business Administration from [Koç University](https://gsb.ku.edu.tr/), the best business school in Turkey, and my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, the best university in Iran. I also spent one sabbatical year during my Ph.D. studies in the Reinforcement Learning and Optimization team of the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) in Stuttgart, Germany.    


My doctoral and postdoctoral research has focused on modeling complex manufacturing, production, and inventory systems and improving their performance using *statistical and machine learning, combinatorial and stochastic optimization, and sequential decision making* methodologies. Working with the top researchers in Operations Research, Management Science, and Machine Learning fields have acquainted me with conducting and leading impactful research. The overall goal of my research has been to *automate and facilitate decision making in uncertain environments* using mathematical methodologies. I have received Ph.D. Academic Excellence reward from Koç University as a recognition of the rigor of my research and published two patents as a result of my ongoing collaboration with the research scientists in BCAI.
