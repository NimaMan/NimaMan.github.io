# About Me
I am Nima Manafzadeh Dizbin. Currently, I am doing postdoctoral research in the Industrial Engineering and Innovations Sciences Department at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I have obtained my Masters and Ph.D. in Business Administration from [Ko√ß University](https://gsb.ku.edu.tr/), the best business school in Turkey, and my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, the best university in Iran. I also spent one sabbatical year during my Ph.D. studies in the Reinforcement Learning and Optimization team of the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) in Stuttgart, Germany.    

Working with the top researchers in **Operations Research, Management Science, and Machine Learning** fields have acquainted me with conducting and leading impactful research. My doctoral and postdoctoral research has focused on modeling complex manufacturing, production, and inventory systems and improving their performance using **statistical and machine learning, combinatorial and stochastic optimization, and sequential decision making** methodologies. My passion is to take these methodologies, combine them with data, computation power, and intuition, and deploy them in improving the practical processes to build autonomous decisions making systems.
